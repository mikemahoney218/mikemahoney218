## Mike Mahoney, Dreaming of Digital Dirt

I'm a PhD candidate in [Colin Beier's lab](https://www.esf.edu/faculty/beier/) at [SUNY-ESF](esf.edu/), working on ways to move New York towards a net-zero carbon future. On the side I maintain a few R packages ([heddlr](https://github.com/mikemahoney218/heddlr) and [spacey](https://github.com/mikemahoney218/spacey)), run a few tweetbots ([@fortunes_teller](https://github.com/mikemahoney218/fortunes_teller), [@ecology_tweets and @rstats_tweets](https://github.com/mikemahoney218/retweet_bot), and [@fund_me_please_](https://twitter.com/fund_me_please_)), and hack on my (PhD-stipend sized) [homelab](https://github.com/mikemahoney218/pi-admin). I'm at my best with R or SQL, but have seen projects through using Bash/Python/Rust/Javascript too.
