# Mike Mahoney, The Ghost in the Machine

I'm a researcher in [Colin Beier's lab](https://www.esf.edu/faculty/beier/), working on machine learning for ecological outcomes, model interpretability, and landscape visualization. I also maintain a handful of R packages:

[![:name status badge](https://mikemahoney218.r-universe.dev/badges/:name)](https://mikemahoney218.r-universe.dev)

| Package | What it does |
|---------|--------------|
| [rsi](https://github.com/Permian-Global-Research/rsi) | Functions for the data processing parts of spatial modeling workflows: download data from STAC APIs, calculate spectral indices, and warp it all together |
| [spatialsample](https://github.com/tidymodels/spatialsample) | A tidymodels package for spatial resampling |
| [waywiser](https://github.com/ropensci/waywiser) | Yardstick extensions for measuring spatial structure in model residuals |
| [terrainr](https://github.com/ropensci/terrainr) | Transform geospatial data for rendering in Unity 3D (and download data from the USGS National Map) |
| [unifir](https://github.com/mikemahoney218/unifir) |  A unifying interface for calling Unity from R  |
| [heddlr](https://github.com/mikemahoney218/heddlr) | Functionally compose R Markdown from repeated components | 
| [proceduralnames](https://github.com/mikemahoney218/proceduralnames) | Generate human-readable random identifiers |
| [mvdf](https://github.com/mikemahoney218/mvdf) | A standardized approach to using R as a frontend for the Blender 3D rendering program |

I've also taken over maintenance of the [geojsonio](https://cran.r-project.org/package=geojsonio) package, though I wrote very little of the actual functionality. While not the package maintainer, I also implemented grouped resampling in [rsample](https://github.com/tidymodels/rsample/) (a tidymodels package for non-spatial resampling), which (alongside spatialsample) I worked on as an intern at [RStudio](https://github.com/rstudio).

I also have written a couple of Quarto extensions:

| Extension | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| [quarto-arxiv](https://github.com/mikemahoney218/quarto-arxiv) | A Quarto template for preprints |
| [quarto-tandf](https://github.com/mikemahoney218/quarto-tandf) | A Quarto template for Taylor and Francis journals |
| [quarto-agu](https://github.com/mikemahoney218/quarto-agu) | A Quarto template for AGU journals -- now part of [quarto-journals](https://github.com/quarto-journals/agu) |
